#+title: README

* Background

I have been an auditor for years, starting with operational/financial audits and 
quickly transitioning to technology audits early in my career.

While performing technology audits, attestations, etc., you will find that it 
requires a lot of manual effort if you don't use the right tools to automate as 
much as possible.

This repository serves as my personal collection of audit tools that I want to 
save and re-use later.

* Development

** Python

For the Python scripts, use the following to activate a virtual environment for 
consistent packing:

#+begin_src sh
python3 -m venv venv
source ./venv/bin/activate
pip install PACKAGE_NAME
python3 ./PYTHON_SCRIPT.py
#+end_src
